## MAT388E-Data Analysis in Fundamental Sciences

**Course Instructor:** [Gül İnan](https://gulinan.github.io/)

**Course Summary:**

<p align="justify">

`MAT388E` is an undergraduate level course which aims to provide an introduction to commonly used statistical methods for inference and prediction problems in data analysis. This course is designed such that:

<ul>

<li>The methods covered will include supervised learning algorithms with a focus on regression and classification problems and unsupervised learning algorithms with a focus on clustering problems,</li>

<li>Application of these methods to data analysis problems and their software implementation will be done via [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).</li>

</ul>

At the end of the semester, the students are expected:

<ul>

<li>To be fluent in the fundamental principles behind several statistical methods,</li>

<li>To be able to apply statistical methods to real life problems and data sets, and</li>

<li>To be prepared for more advanced coursework or industrial internship in machine learning and related fields.</li>

</ul>

</p>

**Course GitHub Organization:** <https://github.com/MAT388E-Spring23> for [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

**Course Prerequisites:**

<p align="justify">

Since the course also touches on the mathematical and statistical theory behind the methods and uses Python for implementation, this course requires the following background:

<ul>

<li>Knowledge of linear algebra, probability, statistics, and optimization,</li>

<li>Familiarity with Python's [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), and [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) libraries,</li>

<li>Familiarity with at least one computational document such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [RStudio Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and</li>

<li>Familiarity with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) commands and [GitHub](https://github.com/) interface.</li>

</ul>

**Class Schedule:**

`CRN 21877:` Mondays between 14:30-17:30 at **OBL1** (Computer Lab).
